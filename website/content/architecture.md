# Architecture

router7 is based on [gokrazy](https://gokrazy.org/): it is an appliance which gets packed into a hard disk image, containing a FAT partition with the kernel, a read-only SquashFS partition for the root file system and an ext4 partition for permanent data.

The individual services can be found in [git.tcp.direct/kayos/rout5/cmd](https://pkg.go.dev/git.tcp.direct/kayos/rout5/cmd)

* Each service runs in a separate process.
* Services communicate with each other by persisting state files. E.g., `cmd/dhcp4` writes `/perm/dhcp4/wire/lease.json`.
* A service notifies other services about state changes by sending them signal `SIGUSR1`.

## Configuration files

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| File | Consumer(s) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/perm/interfaces.json` | `netconfigd` | Set IP/MAC addresses of `uplink0` and `lan0` |
| `/perm/portforwardings.json` | `netconfigd` | Configure nftables port forwarding rules |
| `/perm/dhcp6/duid` | `dhcp6` | Set DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) for obtaining static leases |

| `/perm/dhcp6/wire/lease.json` | `dhcp6` | `netconfigd`, `radvd` | Obtained DHCPv6 lease |
| `/perm/dhcp4d/leases.json` | `dhcp4d` | `dhcp4d`, `dnsd` | DHCPv4 leases handed out (including hostnames) |
